Inspired on the Ook esoteric language, and with the idea from Francisco Grisen, we proudly present this turing-machine esoteric language, ready for fapcode.com
As Oyving's pook code was too big for me, I've rewritten it and left it on a 75-line interpreter for Fapcode (wich has a few diferences from Ook)

The language specification is as follows, basically:

::

    Move the memory pointer to the next cell --> FapUp
    Move the memory pointer to the prev cell --> FapDown
    Increment the current memory pointer value --> FapFapFap
    Decrement the current memory pointer value --> Pr0n
    Read a character from stdin and put it in the memory pointer --> Slurp
    Print the ascii character with equal value to the value in the memory pointer --> Cum
    Execute the next block (until FapEnd) if current pointer is 0 --> Fap?
    Execute the next block (until FapEnd) if current pointer is not 0 --> Fap!
