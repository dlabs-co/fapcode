Inspired on the Ook esoteric language, I've created this turing-machine esoteric language, ready for fapcode.com
I firstly used this https://github.com/oyving/pook code to make the interpreter, but as is was a little bit old-fashioned (back from 2001) and the code was too large for me (150 lines of code), I've practically rewritten it, leaving only stuff that would have been the same way anyways.

The language specification is as follows, basically:
    Move the memory pointer to the next cell --> FapUp
    Move the memory pointer to the prev cell --> FapDown
    Increment the current memory pointer value --> FapFapFap
    Decrement the current memory pointer value --> Pr0n
    Read a character from stdin and put it in the memory pointer --> Slurp
    Print the ascii character with equal value to the value in the memory pointer --> Cum
    Execute the next block (until FapEnd) if current pointer is 0 --> Fap?
    Execute the next block (until FapEnd) if current pointer is not 0 --> Fap!
