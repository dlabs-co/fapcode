This is an interpreter for fapcode, a simple modification using "Fap" instead of Ook to the esoteric language Ook.
Forked from the python ook interpreter by Oyvind Gronnesby, available at https://github.com/oyving/pook
All Ook language specs are working for Fapcode, just replacing "Ook" by Fap.

You can have a look at original Ook docs at:
  http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/ook.html

The language looks like this (extracted from there ^):
    Fap. Fap?
    Move the Memory Pointer to the next array cell.
    Fap? Fap.
    Move the Memory Pointer to the previous array cell.
    Fap. Fap.
    Increment the array cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
    Fap! Fap!
    Decrement the array cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
    Fap. Fap!
    Read a character from STDIN and put its ASCII value into the cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
    Fap! Fap.
    Print the character with ASCII value equal to the value in the cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
    Fap! Fap?
    Move to the command following the matching Ook? Ook! if the value in the cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer is zero. Note that Ook! Ook? and Ook? Ook! commands nest like pairs of parentheses, and matching pairs are defined in the same way as for parentheses.
    Fap? Fap!
    Move to the command following the matching Ook! Ook? if the value in the cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer is non-zero.
